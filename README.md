Covid-19 Live Cases Tracker, fetches the live covid Cases, Recoveries and Deaths around the globe.
This web-app reduces the amount of extensive time invested by user to search and analyise the daily live cases of several countries,
by providing all necessary information with line chart analysis at one place. 

This is a beginner friendly project, build to strenghten the core concepts of React framework, nodejs, and mainly working with API.
Working on this project help me figure out how to:
    1) install packages using npm
    2) use MaterialUI components
    3) work with API, their fetching, manipulation
    4) to deploy a project using google firebase.


Covid-19 Tracker project provides: 
    1) Live covid Cases, Recoveries and Deaths of all countries with clickable tabs,
    2) A dropdown menu to facilitate user to select a specific country,
    3) Map with live Cases with intesity mark, interact with user inputs and display outputs
    4) Table of countries with live total cases, sorted in descending order of cases
    5) Line chart to analyise the per-day Cases, Recoveries and Deaths around the globe
    6) Fully responsive, can be accessed in both android and web formats
